**Real weather for 50 San Francisco neighborhoods. Free API. No key required.**

🌐 **Live API:** [microclimates.solofounders.com](https://microclimates.solofounders.com)

Use with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Clawdbot](https://clawd.bot), or build into your apps.

Built by [Solo Founders](https://solofounders.com).

## Why This Exists

SF has the most dramatic microclimates of any US city.

Weather apps say "San Francisco: 58°F" — but that's useless. It can be 52°F and foggy in the Outer Sunset while it's 65°F and sunny in the Mission, just 3 miles apart.

This API aggregates 150+ outdoor sensors and groups them by neighborhood, so you get *actual* local temperatures — not some airport reading from SFO.

## Try It Instantly

```bash
curl https://microclimates.solofounders.com/sf-weather/mission
```

```json
{
  "neighborhood": "mission",
  "name": "Mission District",
  "temp_f": 58,
  "humidity": 52,
  "pm2_5": 12.1,
  "aqi": 50,
  "aqi_category": "Good",
  "sensor_count": 8
}
```

No API key. No signup. Just use it.

# SF Microclimates Skill

Get real-time SF neighborhood weather.

## Triggers
- "weather in [neighborhood]"
- "sf weather mission vs sunset"
- "is it foggy in the richmond?"

## Usage
curl https://microclimates.solofounders.com/sf-weather/marina

## Neighborhoods
mission, castro, marina, soma, haight, noe_valley,
outer_sunset, inner_sunset, outer_richmond, presidio,
north_beach, pacific_heights, potrero, twin_peaks...
```

---

## Use Cases

- **AI agents** — Give your agent real local weather context
- **Home automation** — Trigger based on your actual neighborhood temp
- **Slack/Discord bots** — Settle "is it foggy?" arguments
- **Travel apps** — Show tourists what to actually expect
- **Personal dashboards** — Finally, weather that matches your window

## Air Quality

Each response includes real-time air quality data from PurpleAir sensors.

### Response Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `pm2_5` | PM2.5 concentration in µg/m³ (10-minute rolling average) |
| `aqi` | Air Quality Index (0-500 scale) |
| `aqi_category` | Human-readable AQI category |

### AQI Categories

| AQI Range | Category | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 0–50 | Good | Air quality is satisfactory |
| 51–100 | Moderate | Acceptable; moderate health concern for sensitive individuals |
| 101–150 | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups | Sensitive groups may experience health effects |
| 151–200 | Unhealthy | Everyone may begin to experience health effects |
| 201–300 | Very Unhealthy | Health alert; everyone may experience serious effects |
| 301+ | Hazardous | Health emergency; entire population affected |

### Calculation Method

AQI is calculated from PM2.5 using the **US EPA formula**:

1. The `pm2.5_10minute` field (10-minute rolling average) is used for real-time responsiveness
2. PM2.5 concentration is mapped to AQI breakpoints per EPA standards
3. Linear interpolation determines the final AQI value

This gives you accurate, hyperlocal air quality — not a city-wide average from a distant monitoring station.

## Self-Hosting

Want to run your own instance?

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solo-founders/sf-microclimates.git
cd sf-microclimates
npm install
```

### 2. Get a PurpleAir API Key

This API uses [PurpleAir](https://www.purpleair.com/) sensors. Sign up at [develop.purpleair.com](https://develop.purpleair.com/) — free for personal use.

### 3. Create KV Namespace

```bash
wrangler kv:namespace create "CACHE"
```

Add the output to `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "CACHE"
id = "your-kv-namespace-id"
```

### 4. Set Your API Key

```bash
wrangler secret put PURPLEAIR_API_KEY
```

### 5. Deploy

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### Local Development

```bash
echo "PURPLEAIR_API_KEY=your-key" > .dev.vars
wrangler dev
```

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `3600` | Cache duration (1 hour) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | `60` | Max requests per IP |

---

## How It Works

1. Request comes in → rate limit check
2. Check Cloudflare KV cache → return if fresh
3. Cache miss → fetch outdoor sensors from PurpleAir (`location_type=0`)
4. Group sensors by neighborhood GPS bounding boxes
5. Calculate averages, cache for 1 hour
6. Return JSON with CORS headers

---

## Fork for Your City

LA, Seattle, NYC, Chicago, Austin — every city has microclimates.

The neighborhood bounding boxes are in `src/index.ts`. To adapt:

1. Update `SF_NEIGHBORHOODS` with your city's areas + GPS coordinates
2. Change the PurpleAir bounding box to your city
3. Update branding
4. Deploy

PRs welcome! We'd love to see `la-microclimates`, `nyc-microclimates`, etc.
